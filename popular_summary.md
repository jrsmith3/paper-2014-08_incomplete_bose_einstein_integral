Understanding how light is thermally emitted from a semiconductor is fundamentally important to understanding the functionality and improvement of several energy technologies: from determining the efficiency of solar cells to more advanced technologies like photo-enhanced thermoelectron engines. In this paper, I derive a simple mathematical equation to describe the thermal emission of light from a semiconductor. Presently, physicists rely on approximations of this spectrum or on complicated algorithms.

Matter at any temperature emits particles of light known as photons. One can easily find familiar examples of this phenomenon: visible light from the filament of an incandescent bulb, light from the sun, even the human body emits photons (mostly in the infrared). These examples are known as "blackbodies," and their thermal photons are emitted over a range of energies from zero to infinity according to a model well-known by physicists.

Semiconductors are a type of material which differ from blackbodies because they posess a property known as a bandgap. The bandgap is the amount of energy required to liberate electrons from fixed positions within the material so that they can conduct electricity. Because of its bandgap, a semiconductor cannot emit thermal photons of energy less than the value of the bandgap, whereas blackbodies can emit photons of energy all the way down to zero.

The difference in the thermal photon spectra of blackbodies vs. semiconductors comes into play, for example, when determining the optimally efficient design of a solar cell. The efficiency of a solar cell is determined by balancing all of the energy entering and leaving the device; energy enters the device via the solar blackbody photons, and some leaves as a result of thermal photon emission from the device.

This expression can be used to calculate the number of thermal photons emitted from a semiconductor and the energy carried away by thermal photons, among other things. The equation I derive can be implemented using straightforward algorithms that can be quickly and accurately computed using a normal computer or laptop. I check the equation and algorithms by comparing their output to well-known, past results of solar cells.
