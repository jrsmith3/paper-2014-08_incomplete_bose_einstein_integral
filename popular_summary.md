In this paper, I derive a simple mathematical equation to describe the thermal emission of light from a semiconductor. The thermal spectrum for semicondcturs differs from the thermal spectrum for "blackbody" matter because semiconductors posess a property known as a bandgap, and it is physically impossible for light with less energy than the bandgap to be emitted by a semiconductor. Presently, physicists rely on approximations or complicated algorithms to descibe the thermal emission spectrum for semiconductors. This calculation is relevant to the fundamental physics of several energy technologies: from solar cell efficiency optimization to photon-enhanced thermoelectron engines.

The equation derived in this paper is implemented using straightforward algorithms which can be quickly and accurately calculated using a normal computer. The equation can be used to calculate the number of thermal photons emitted from a semiconductor and the energy carried away by thermal photons, among other things. To show the accuracy of the derivation, I compare the ouptut of the equation and algorithms to well-known, past results of the output from solar cells.
