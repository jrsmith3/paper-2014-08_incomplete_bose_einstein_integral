Matter at any temperature emits particles of light known as photons. This phenomenon is leveraged by incandescent lightbulbs: a tungsten filament is heated and glows to provide light. Photons from a heated body are emitted over a range of different energies; the temperature of the heated body determines which energy the majority of the emitted photons take according to a model well-known by physicists. Light from the sun roughly obeys this same spectrum.

The shape of the spectrum is key to determining how best to design a solar cell because solar cells are made from materials known as semiconductors, and semiconductors are characterized by a property known as a bandgap. The bandgap is the amount of energy required to free an electron from a fixed position within the material so that it can conduct electricity through the semiconductor. If the bandgap is too big, many of the photons striking the solar cell will be lost because they won't have enough energy to liberate fixed electrons. If the bandgap is too small, an unacceptable portion of the photon energy striking the solar cell will be converted to heat.

The efficiency of a solar cell is determined by balancing all the energy entering and leaving the device; part of this balance is determined by the photons emitted from the device because no solar cell can be held at absolute zero temperature. The spectrum of photons emitted from a semiconductor is similar to the well-known spectrum of a tungsten filament or the sun, but is truncated at energies less than the bandgap. Physicists have known for decades that the semiconductor thermal photon spectrum is truncated, but few have written a rigorous mathematical equation determining the spectrum. In this paper, I derive a simple mathematical equation for the photon spectrum from a semiconductor. This expression can be used to calculate the number of thermal photons emitted from a semiconductor and the energy carried away by thermal photons, among other things. The equation I derive can be implemented using straightforward algorithms that can be quickly and accurately computed using a normal computer or laptop. I check the equation and algorithms by comparing their output to well-known, past results of solar cells.
