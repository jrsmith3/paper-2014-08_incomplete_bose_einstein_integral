In this paper, I derive a simple mathematical equation to describe the thermal emission of light from a semiconductor. The thermal spectrum for semicondcturs differs from the thermal spectrum for "blackbody" matter because semiconductors posess a property known as a bandgap and cannot emit thermal photons of energy less than the value of the bandgap. The equation I derived is implemented using straightforward algorithms which can be quickly and accurately calculated using a normal computer. Presently, physicists rely on approximations or complicated algorithms to descibe the thermal emission spectrum for semiconductors.

Understanding (the value?) how light is thermally emitted from a semiconductor is important to understanding the functionality and improvement of several energy technologies: from determining the efficiency of solar cells to more advanced technologies like photo-enhanced thermoelectron engines.
