Dear Editors,
I am submitting the manuscript entitled, "Analytic solution to the upper incomplete Bose-Einstein integral," to Physical Review X for review for publication. 

Computing the value of the upper incomplete Bose-Einstein integral is central to calculating the efficiency limits of solar cells in the detailed balance limit. In this manuscript, the upper incomplete Bose-Einstein integral is expressed as a finite sum of polylogarithm functions. Polylogarithms have the attractive property of rapid convergence, resulting in rapid and precise calculations of such quantities as photon number flux and photon energy flux from semiconductors at finite temperatures.

The precision of the resulting expression for the upper incomplete Bose-Einstein integral is analyzed and is shown to be limited by the precision to which Boltzmann's and Planck's constants are known. It is further shown that the finite sum of polylogarithms can be evaluated in a reasonable amount of time on commodity computing hardware.

To check the derivation, the upper incomplete Bose-Einstein integral is implemented as a module in the python programming language. This implementation is used to recover well-known results of solar cell efficiency published by Shockley and Queisser and DeVos.

Kind regards,
Joshua R. Smith
